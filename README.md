# Fruit Ninja Game :watermelon: :apple: :lemon:
## Epic Story
> In the mystical land of FMI, where fruits grow to extraordinary sizes and possess magical properties, a fierce and ancient order of warriors known as the FMI's Fruit Ninjas protect the realm. These warriors harness the power of elemental blades, each reflecting the essence of their skill and the spirit of the fruits they protect.

Long ago, the peaceful kingdom of FMI thrived under the protection of the Fruit Ninjas. However, a dark sorcerer named :no_mouth: Restanta :no_mouth: sought to dominate FMI by corrupting the magical fruits and unleashing restante upon the students. The Fruit Ninjas fought valiantly but were ultimately scattered, and their sacred blades lost their power.

To defeat **Restanta** and his minions, you must restore the elemental power to the sacred blades by harnessing the essence of different fruits. 

**Are you ready?** :wink:
